brief: Mute and solo individual audio channels

desc: >
 "j.mutesolo~ enables muting or soloing of individual signals in a multi-channel audio stream."

inputs:
 - name: left
   desc: "The number of inlets and outlets for j.mutesolo~ is determined by the number of channels specified as an argument to the object. 
"

outputs:
 - name: left
   desc: "The number of inlets and outlets for j.mutesolo~ is determined by the number of channels specified as an argument to the object. 
 - name: right
   desc: "dumpout"

args:
 - name: channels
   type: integer
   desc: "The number of channels of the signal to process. This determines the number of inlets and outlets of the object."

messages:
 - name: clear
   type: none
   desc: Resets the object to its default settings where none of the channels are muted or soloed.
   unit:
   default:
 - name: getChannelMute
   type: none
   desc: A @getChannelMute@ message returns current mute settings for all channels as a list at the dumpout outlet.
   unit:
   default:
 - name: getChannelSolo
   type: generic
   desc: A @getChannelSolo@ message returns current solo settings for all channels as a list at the dumpout outlet.
   unit:
   default:
 - name: setChannelMute
   type: array [channel mute-value]
   desc: A @setChannelMute@ message followed by an integer specifying the channel (counting from 0) and a mute-value mute this channel if the value is non-zero, and un.mutes it if the value is zero. If one or more channels are soloed, it overrides any current settings for channel mute.
   unit:
   default:
 - name: setChannelSolo
   type: generic
   desc: A @setChannelSolo@ message followed by an integer specifying the channel (counting from 0) and a solo-value soloes this channel if the value is non-zero, and stops the soloing if the value is zero. If one or more channels are soloed, it overrides any current settings for channel mute.
   unit:
   default:
 - name: signal
   type: signal
   desc: Each inlet/outlet pair is used for muting and soloing of one channel.
   unit:
   default
     
attributes:
 - name: bypass
   type: boolean
   desc: "When non-zero, signal processing in this object is bypassed."
   unit:
   default: 0.
 - name: interpolate
   type: boolean
   desc: "When non-zero, gain levels for each channel is interpolated to new values iver one sample vector if channel mute or solo settings are changed."
   unit:
   default: 0.
 - name: mute
   type: boolean
   desc: "When non-zero, signal processing in this object is muted."
   unit:
   default: 0.

   type: symbol
