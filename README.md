### Set up 

Here are the steps to clone and build JamomaMax :
    
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaMax.git
    cd JamomaMax
    ./build.sh --multi

There are additional options to the `build.sh` command, including : 

    --help
    List all available options and what they do.
    --multi
    Builds using all your cores.
    --universal
    Builds an universal binary for OS X. Warning: does not work well with brew; portmidi and gecode have to be built by hand
    --win64
    Creates projects for 64-bits on Windows.
    --optimize
    Builds with optimizations enabled. More speed, but is not suitable for distribution on older computers or different processors.
    --clean
    Removes the build folder and the executables prior to building.
    --install
    Install into /usr/local/jamoma
    --package
    Create a ready-for-distribution package 
    --uninstall
    Remove /usr/local/jamoma
